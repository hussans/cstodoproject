**Project Name**: Task Tracker
<br/>
**Description**: This project is a desktop task manager that lets users add, edit, and organize tasks easily. Each task includes a name, description, status (To-Do, In Progress, Complete), priority (Low, Medium, High), and a due date. Tasks automatically move to the right section when their status changes, without refreshing the page. The app is built using JavaScript modules with import/export and focuses on a smooth, dynamic experience.
